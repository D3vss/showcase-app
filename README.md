# Showcase: A platform to showcase your portfolio and get job opportunities (***project still in progress***)
The platform has the same purpose as LinkedIn, but with a much simpler and easy to use UI. And with an easier and straight forward logic.

## Technologies: 
For the technologies used, I decided to develop the ***Front-end*** with **React-JS**, The **Back-end** with **NodeJS** and I choose **Mongo-DB** as a database.

## Ressources:
- Installing Node js : 
    * [For windows click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    * [For Linux click here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

- To start your react project: </br>
```npx create-react-app myReactApp ```

- I used [Styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) library to easily create and style my components:</br>
``` npm i styled-components ``` 

- [ExpressJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) (*for the backend*) :</br>
```npm i express```
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) to manage MongoDB: </br>
```npm i mongoose```

- Assets: </br>
